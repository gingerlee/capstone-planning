### React Capstone Project, Epicodus

## Project Goal

This a socially-minded application that is a curated workout program that will allow a group of users (a team) to join a 21-day workout challenge that will allow them to view a free youTube video for each day. After the workout is complete the user will add their name to the list of teammates who have completed the day's workout. Users will see all teammates who have completed the dayâ€™s workout.

 The goal of this app is to leverage free workout content to a group of interested people and for them to be able to hold themselves accountable for the workout by seeing who has complete the workouts.

 **Backstory**: The user in mind is a new mom who does not have much time to leave the house, who wants to get back in shape, and who also is on a budget. This is the very situation I was in last summer, and found myself using free youtube workout videos to get in short and quick home workouts, but without paying or being in a studio, it was hard to keep motivated and accountable. That experience and slight challenge to stay motivated gave me the idea to build a team workout app that uses the social aspect of a team to keep each other motivated. I am excited to build this because it encourages people to be active and healthy, and also builds community -- and it's fun!
