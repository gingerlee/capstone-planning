# Squats App
### ðŸ’ª React Capstone Project, Epicodus

**Ginger Lee Kretschmer** -- _February 23 2018_


## Project Description and Goal

This a socially-minded team workout application that allows a group of users (a team) to join a 21-day workout challenge. The challenge is composed of a curated list of free youTube videos, one for each day. After the workout is complete the user will add their name to the list of teammates who have completed the day's workout. Users will see all teammates who have completed the dayâ€™s workout.

The goal of this app is to leverage free workout content to a group of interested people and for them to be able to hold themselves accountable for the workout by seeing who has complete the workouts.

**Backstory**: The user in mind is a new mom who does not have much time to leave the house, who wants to get back in shape, and who also is on a budget. This is the very situation I was in last summer, and found myself using free youtube workout videos to get in short and quick home workouts, but without paying or being in a studio, it was hard to keep fully motivated and accountable. That experience and slight challenge to stay committed to the workouts gave me the idea to build a team workout app that uses the social aspect of a team to keep each other motivated. I am excited to build this because it encourages people to be active and healthy, and also builds community -- and it's fun!

## Minimum Viable Product Features
_A list of the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet_

#### HomePage:
* **See User Name logged in:** Users will be able to see their name logged in at the top of the screen at all times. Logging in and out will be additional features after MVP.

* **See Challenge Details:** Users will be able to view details of challenge.

* **See Video List:** Users will be able to view all videos in a list for the challenge.

#### Video Detail Page:
* **Play video:** Users will be able to view and play the video of the day within the application in an iframe (iframe controls will allow user to play, pause, volume). Video will be stored in Firebase and will use a YouTube API.

* **View team leaderboard:** User will be able to see which teammates, including themselves, have completed the workout video of the day.



## Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs for MVP
* React (I want to do this in React Native, but will make that a refractor for Demo Day)
* Redux
* Jest (for unit testing)
* React Youtube NPM package

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
